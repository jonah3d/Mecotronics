I had a few lectures on it during my associate degree and became fond of it, mainly because the languages I use on a daily basis ( Java / C# ) are object-oriented. Naturally, a project based on pure objects fits this interest of mine best. Therefore, I decided to build an electronic shop with multiple applications for selling, managing, and purchasing electronic products. Deliverables By the end of this project, I aim to present the following applications: Backend (Spring Boot) Point-of-Sale Application (WinUI) Inventory Management (Swing) Web UI (React) These correspond to the different application projects that will be developed: Matisse Enterprise Management Project Spring Boot Project Inventory Application Point-of-Sale Application Web Application Development Approach There isn't a one-size-fits-all approach to developing an application of this magnitude. For the sake of my sanity\u2014and to minimize major rewrites and refactoring\u2014I've chosen to follow the Lean Startup methodology. Since this project consists of multiple applications, it would be unwise to fully design the database before building out the backend. If any issues arise later, they could require extensive refactoring. To avoid that, I\u2019ll develop the database and backend in tandem and with an incremental approach. This allows me to quickly prototype features and make necessary changes along the way.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#mecotronics-documentation","text":"","title":"Mecotronics Documentation"},{"location":"#project-brief","text":"The main objective of this project is to develop a real-world application based on the object-oriented database Matisse .
